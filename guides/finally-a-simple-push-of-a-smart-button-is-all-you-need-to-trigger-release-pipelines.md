Today we will build a server and databases using :

* Azure Devops
* ARM Templates
* A Flic Button

If you don't own a Flic Button, [you can purchase one here](https://flic.io/shop/flic-1pack).

Before we begin, if you're looking for a quick summary and overview on Azure Devops Pipelines \(or found this page early and would like to get a headstart\), I recommend[ starting here with the documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), or taking 4 minutes to read in more detail [how to create your first devops pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs=tfs-2018-2) , so you have some context on how to use pipelines.

#### Let Us Begin!

Today we will trigger a azure devops pipelines using a Flic button. We will start by creating a release pipelines using azure devops. Then we will create a flic account, create flic actions to trigger release pipeline

Here's a diagram of what we'll be doing:
