# Twilio Signal 2019 Recap

We are just back from the Twilio Signal 2019 conference in San Francisco. With over 3000 people attending, it was a huge event and crossing the golden gate bridge reminded me the most beautiful bridge in the world. Twilio has announced that they are going to run signal Moscone Center  in 2020 and I bet they’ve received a ton of advice from attendees that will help to make the 2020 event better.

Twilio usually focuses on the main keynote, sub keynotes, and product keynotes. This year conference started with Jeff Lawson CEO vision keynote. This year’s main theme was “Don’t talk about code, show it”. I love attending and listening to Jeff & Other Industry Experts from Netflix, Lyft, Door Dash, Shopify and many more companies vision toward communications and providing awesome customer experience and after the keynotes I have attended the programmable sms, voice and cloud contact center platforms workshops and tech booths.

 My highlights of the event are as follows.

**Twilio Ecosystem \| Keynote**

It’s a company **“By Developers for Developers”** with over  160,000 customers around the world and more than 6 million developers building an amazing things every day on Twilio platform. Together, building the future of engagement in communications with 750 Billion human interactions last year. That’s 32,500 calls per minute, up to 13000 peak SMS per second and reached out to 2.8 billion unique phone number annually, and 3 billion unique email address every quarter.

**Mega Trends for 2020 \| Twilio CEO**

The era of web apps and mobile apps is winding down and what next? Is it Alexa, Google Home, Sri or Bot what is it? its era of conversations - Jeff 

Conversation are eating apps as the most compelling, easiest to use and ways to engage with the customers to do business with.

After seeing the patterns from 160,000 companies Twilio learned that customers are actually trying to reach back with their questions but 75 % companies haven’t configured the inbound handlers to answer the questions. We are one among them and not listening to customer questions through channels.

For Example we sent a text message and the customer replied with blah blah  we never replied back again to customer which  we can able to fix this with technology. Interestingly when Twilio launches WhatsApp Api  51 % of the customers replied and shared the Nordstrom story of customer engagement by text messages as conversation.

Amazon, Grub hub, Shopify, Lyft, Uber, Marriot and lot tech companies already started creating this sophisticated workflows through messages and other channels.

Most importantly  lot of changes were made to RCS. which was never happened in the last 40 years of telecom industry.

**Adding a Verified Called ID \| Keynote**

A Twilio Study found that more than 75% of the calls they receive on their cell are not answered due to rise in spam and robocalls.To prevent this happening twilio empowers the consumers to know  who is calling them and why, giving them the confidence to answer the phone again and the same way with the text as well with verified by twilio branding. 

Verified By Twilio displays company branding and a reason for the call right in front of the consumer, giving them confidence in answering. its a pretty innovative service in the communication industry which will get more customer engagement.
