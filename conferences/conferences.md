# Twilio Signal 2019 Recap

We are just back from the Twilio Signal 2019 conference in San Francisco. With over 3000 people attending, it was a huge event and crossing the golden gate bridge reminded me the most beautiful bridge in the world. Twilio has announced that they are going to run signal in Moscone Center in SFO  in 2020 and I bet they’ve received a ton of advice from attendees that will help to make the 2020 event better.

Twilio usually focuses on the main keynote, sub keynotes, and product keynotes. This year conference started with Jeff Lawson CEO vision keynote. This year’s main theme was “Don’t talk about code, show it”. I love attending and listening to Jeff & Other Industry Experts from Netflix, Lyft, Door Dash, Shopify and many more companies vision toward communications and providing awesome customer experience and after the keynotes I have attended the programmable sms, voice and cloud contact center platforms workshops and tech booths.

 My highlights of the event are as follows.

It’s a company **“By Developers for Developers”** with over  160,000 customers around the world and more than 6 million developers building an amazing things every day on Twilio platform.

That’s 32,500 calls per minute, up to 13000 peak SMS per second and reached out to 2.8 billion unique phone number annually, and 3 billion unique email address every quarter.

After seeing the patterns from 160,000 companies Twilio learned that customers are actually trying to reach back with their questions but 75 % companies haven’t configured the inbound handlers to answer the questions. We are one among them and not listening to customer questions through channels.

For Example we sent a text message and the customer replied with blah blah  and companies never replied back again. Interestingly when Twilio launches WhatsApp Api  51 % of the customers replied and shared the Nordstrom story of customer engagement by text messages as conversation.
